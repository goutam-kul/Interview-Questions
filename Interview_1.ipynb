    "- The customer churn application I built is able to predict based on the historical data and customer demographic which custmer will leave the company. Customer churn is a major problem for all the service based, subscription based company. My model can essentially make predictions on if the customer will leave the company or not and this can help the company take necessary actions to decrease attrition rates."

I used REST API in my customer churn project to POST data from my front end form to the model so that we can GET prediction from the model and show it in the frontend. "

    "- Linear Regression is an statistical technique to fit a relation between two variables, given that they have a linear relation. for eg- the weight and height of a human has a linear relation so depending on the height we can estimate an arbitary value for the weight. This is what Linear regression is in Laymen terms. "

In logistic regression a logit transformation(log odds) is applied to the odds of the event. Since the output is probability it can be used in classification task as well."

Convolutional Neural Nets are very good at processing Tablular data and since digital images are set of Pixel values stored in tabular form, CNN work very well with them.\n",
